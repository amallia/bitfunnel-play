# BitFunnel Play

[Bitfunnel](https://github.com/BitFunnel/BitFunnel)
is a fast, reliable document search engine based on Bloom filter signatures, rather than inverted indexes.
Bing's use of BitFunnel resulted in substantial operational cost savings.
["BitFunnel: Revisiting Signatures for Search"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3080789) won Best Paper at Sigir '17.
This [22 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Xoy5w5ydM) provides a helpful introduction
to BitFunnel's innovative search technology.

This repository offers tools that simplify the work needed to set up a BitFunnel environment
and compare the performance and operational behavior of BitFunnel to other notable
document search engines, such as Lucene, MG4J and Partitioned Elias Fano.
